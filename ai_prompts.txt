Environment Setup
I am using Python 3.11.10 in a virtual environment named myenv.
My working directory is:
/Users/omararias/dev/Python/bw_monitor
My shell is: /bin/zsh.
Purpose of the App
The app monitors bandwidth consumption in MB for both incoming and outgoing data. It is designed to help track internet usage, particularly with expensive paid on-demand internet services.

Core Features
Default Behavior:

The app starts with a default threshold of 100 MB (total usage).
The refresh rate is set to 5 seconds by default.

Bandwidth Monitoring:

Monitors bandwidth usage in real-time and displays:
Per refresh period: Incoming and outgoing bandwidth usage (in MB).
Cumulative totals: total in, total out, and total accumulated in MB.
The total accumulated usage will also display in GB (in parentheses) with two decimal places for all displayed values.

Display Behavior:

The app behaves like the top command:
Takes over the terminal screen without scrolling.
Refreshes continuously, even while listening for keystrokes.
Keyboard Commands
Reset Accumulated Usage:

Press R or r:
Resets the accumulated bandwidth usage to 0 MB.
Displays a summary of previous usage, including:
Total bandwidth used (in MB).
The number of times the threshold was reached.
Quit the App:

Press Q or q:
Quits the app.
Displays a final summary, including:
Total bandwidth used (in MB).
The number of times the threshold was reached.
Displays a goodbye message.
Set New Refresh Rate:

Press U or u:
Specify a new refresh rate in seconds.
Set Thresholds:

Press T or t:
Specify a new total threshold in MB.
Press I or i:
Specify a new incremental threshold (maximum bandwidth allowed per refresh period) in MB.
Help Menu:

Press H or h:
Displays a help menu summarizing all available commands and options.
Threshold Alerts
When the total threshold is reached:
Display the message:
CAUTION: High consumption! Threshold <threshold> MB has been reached.
Play three beeps to alert the user.
Development Requirements
Code Structure:

The Python implementation must use classes.
Follow Python best practices, including:
Type hinting for all methods and variables.
Short and clear comments explaining methods, variables, and key sections of the code.

File Outputs:

Generate a requirements.txt file listing all required libraries.
Generate a README.md file with:
Project description and instructions for use.
The Logotipo PNG.png logo included at the top.
Generate a LICENSE.txt file with:
Permission for non-commercial use of the software.
Create a .gitignore file:
To exclude macOS .DS_Store hidden files.
Environment Activation Script:

Provide a script to activate the virtual environment.
Optional Command-Line Arguments:

Allow specification of the threshold (total usage) in MB.
Allow specification of the refresh rate in seconds.
